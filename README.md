seat

This app is a group project from General Assembly -> Web Development Immersive program.

The team consists of Jackson Sandland (owner of this repo), Darren Wong, and Franco Colaizzi.

This app is a full-service yield managment app for restaurants.  The name of the platform is `seat` and it contains within a mobile-ready, high end design web app for any given restaurant's customers to use for scheduling, editing, and managing reservations.  Users are not only pampered visually as they navigate the web app, but they are also given email notifications whenever they create a new reservation and when they update an existing one.  Through tight integration with Heroku Scheduler and Twilio, we are also able to provide users with a 24hr reminder text, sent the day before their reservation.  Users can even use the app with Facebook credentials.

As for the restaurant side of the service, there is a fully functional admin dashboard (provided by ActiveAdmin) allowing the restaurant admins to schedule reservations, edit existing reservations, view/sort every reservation, manage table/section/server assignments down to which customer/reservation a server is assigned.  Administrator also have the ability to create servers (for new hirees) and create/delete tables (to help keep the system up to date at any given moment).

Planned Updates
====
The planned updates include support for managing finances (pay rate, total cost of meal for a reservation, etc) and automated assignment of reservations to tables based on the size of the party and what spacing (including physical arrangement of tables and the current state of affairs of the restaurant) is available at a given time.
